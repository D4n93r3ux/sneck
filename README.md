# Sneck

A basic recreation of the classic mobile phone game in the terminal, using Python.


## Installation

Set up a virtual environment, then create an editable installation using

`pip install -e .`

from the root directory (where pyproject.toml is located).

Then run `make` or execute `scripts/main.py`.


## Controls

The game is an opportunity to practice your Vim navigation keys :)
